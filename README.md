 Comma Pedal Support Files for ZVW50

This repo contains comma pedal support files for the Toyota Prius (ZVW50), mainly wiring diagrams and what each wire does (see the report pdf) so users do not have to use a multimeter and measure things.

This comes with no warranty and you will be responsible for your own road safety. Please use the files provided responsibly.

This repo is mainly for my personal reference.
